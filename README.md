# Movie_Data_Analysis

## Getting started
### Downloading Datasets
First thing you need to do is create an `.env` file with your kaggle credentials
```
KAGGLE_USERNAME=username_here
KAGGLE_KEY=kaggle_api_key_here
```

Next you need to ensure you have your required dependencies installed depending on your environment

-   If on Colab uncomment the code on lines 3-5 and set the `imUsingColab` flag to `True`

-   If running locally install the dependencies manually using
```
pip install python-dotenv
pip install kaggle
```

Now you are ready to run the script
